Data Structures and Algorithms

Solving DSA problems is interesting and a hobby for me. 
This project contains the solutions of the leet code problems.

The file naming convention of the solution is explained below.

LCXXXX(SubOptimal|Optimal)(Approach)Solution.java

XXXX - corresponds to problem number in leetcode. For e.g: LC0014-Longest Common Prefix
SubOptiomal|Optimal - SubOptimal or Optimal Solution.
Approach - Tree, LinkedList, Tree, DP etc.
